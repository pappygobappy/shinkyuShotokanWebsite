            For over 50 years, Sensei Sue dedicated her life to karate and to Shinkyu Shotokan. While it was originally founded
            by Sensei Leroy Rodrigues, it was Sensei Sue who grew Shinkyu Shotokan into the far-reaching, deeply connected
            community we know today. She directly impacted hundreds of students of all ages through her classes, and was the
            driving force behind all of our events, including the promotionals, beach workouts, and tournaments. Her teachings
            extended far beyond the dojo walls, shaping generations with lessons in respect, perseverance, and self-belief.
            <br /><br />
            In the early 1990s, Sensei Sue recognized the need for a children’s karate class, and founded our first pre-karate
            program. Here, students as young as three years old are welcomed as true karate practitioners. Under Sensei Sue’s
            guidance, they didn’t just play martial arts, they learned discipline, respect, and foundational techniques with the
            same care and seriousness as their older peers. While starting as a small class, the program has become one of our
            biggest classes today. Later on, she would take even more responsibility, starting the women’s self defense class,
            and taking on the teen and adult classes. Hundreds of people over the years found strength, focus, and friendship
            under her guidance.
            <br /><br />
            She had a gift for seeing the potential in everyone who came into her class, and knew just how to help them rise to
            meet it. Whether it was a shy child afraid to leave their parents, a teenager battling self-doubt, or an adult just
            wanting to better themselves, Sensei Sue met each student with patience, humor, and encouragement.
            <br /><br />
            Sensei Sue also saw the importance of exposing her students to experiences outside of class. With the
            promotionals, Sensei Sue brought students from every class together to test for their next rank, reinforcing the
            belief that every practitioner, regardless of age or level, deserved equal respect and recognition. She started the
            beach workouts as a way to bring our school together with neighboring dojos, turning training into a celebration and
            strengthening bonds across the martial arts community. And in the year 2000, she started our annual tournament,
            drawing hundreds of martial artists every year from the Bay Area and across the globe.
            <br /><br />
            Her dedication to her students and community knew no limits. Together with her husband Ron, Sensei Sue often
            welcomed parents, students, and friends into their home for dinners and celebrations. Their annual tamale fest was a
            beloved tradition that brought everyone together with laughter, warmth, and unforgettable flavor. They would often
            host visiting instructors when they came for special events. And when students or friends faced hard times, they
            would offer a place to stay.
            <br /><br />
            Though she is no longer with us, Sensei Sue’s legacy lives on. Her spirit echoes in every past and current student,
            in every parent who watches their child grow stronger and more confident, and in every
            instructor who carries forward her mission of teaching with strength and heart.
            <br /><br />
            We miss you Sensei.

            <p>The Shinkyu Shotokan Karate dojo practices traditional Shotokan, as well as elements from the older martial
                arts of Shorinji Ryu. Students attain knowledge and proficiency of self-defense in a spiritual, mental and
                physical way. They develop confidence, build up endurance, focus and self-awareness in a friendly
                atmosphere. Shinkyu Shotokan Karate was established in 1965 by Sensei Leroy Rodrigues.</p>
